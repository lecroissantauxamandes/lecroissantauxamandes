ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m **@lecroissantauxamandes**. I am a Californian who tends to update her github from cafes that serve croissants.

ðŸ‘€ For the purposes of this github account, Iâ€™m primarily interested in (1) mange-ing on croissants (Thank you, Duolingo. Tu manges un croissant, Paul mange un croissant, etc.) and (2) upping my math/ stats/ econometrics/ DS knowledge so that I can tackle interesting research questions.

ðŸŒ± As such, visitors should expect bifurcated updates: (1) monthly croissant, generally almond, reviews (2) weekly math-y topic of the moment commits.  

ðŸ˜„ Let's see where this goes, shall we?
